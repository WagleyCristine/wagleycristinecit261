  <h2> This first example uses the canvas tag in HTML5. I have <br> created a simple shape.
    This can also be used with animations <br> and for making charts and much more. <h2>

<canvas id="canvas" width="400px" height="400px">If you can see this then your browser is not awesome enough to view my cool shape.</canvas>

<script>

var shape = document.getElementById("canvas").getContext('2d');

shape.beginPath();
shape.arc(200, 200, 100, 0, 2*Math.PI);
shape.fillStyle = "#FF0000";
shape.fill();
shape.clearRect(175, 200, 50, 90);

shape.lineWidth = 10;
shape.strokeStyle = "#ff6666";
shape.stroke();
